<p>Since there's no <code>WHERE</code> clause, we go directly to <code>GROUP BY</code>. It tells us to categorize the data by both <code>name</code> and <code>age</code>. We end up with a group of all the people named Ace who are 20 years old, a group of all the people named Ace who are 7 years old, a group of all the people named Ada who are 18 years old, and a group of all the people named Ada who are 27 years old.</p>
