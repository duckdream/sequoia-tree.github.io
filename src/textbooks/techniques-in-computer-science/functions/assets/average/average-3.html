<p>Finally we arrive at the last line of code, <code>avg = average(4, z, z - 2)</code>. Unfortunately we don't know the value of <code>average(4, z, z - 2)</code> so we don't know what to bind to <code>avg</code> yet. So now we have to figure out what the function call <code>average(4, z, z - 2)</code> evaluates to.</p>
