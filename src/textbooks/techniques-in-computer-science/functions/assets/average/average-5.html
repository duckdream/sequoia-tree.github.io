<p>Then we have to evaluate everything written on the flag banner: <code>average</code>, <code>4</code>, <code>z</code>, and <code>z - 2</code>. We'll start with <code>average</code>. Keep in mind that when we evaluate a variable, we need to look it up in the frame above the flag. In this example that's the global frame, so that's where we'll be looking up <code>average</code>. When we search for <code>average</code> in the global frame, we see it's bound to an arrow. Copy that arrow down into the banner, just beneath where we've written <code>average</code>.</p>
