<p>We also have to evaluate the other things written on the flag's banner: <code>4</code>, <code>z</code>, and <code>z - 2</code>.</p>
<ol>
<li><code>4</code> directly evaluates to 4.</li>
<li>To get <code>z</code> we follow the same steps we used to evaluate <code>average</code>. We look it up in the global frame and find out it's bound to 8.</li>
<li>To get <code>z - 2</code> it's a similar process. Look up <code>z</code> in the global frame, subtract 2, and we get 6.</li>
</ol>
<p>Write these values underneath their respective expressions in the flag's banner. Check that you understand everything up to this point.</p>
