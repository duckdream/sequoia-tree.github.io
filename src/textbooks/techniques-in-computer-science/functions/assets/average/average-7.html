<p>Now that we know all the constituent parts of our function call, we have to actually perform the computation. Importantly, this doesn't happen in the global frame. Instead we're going to open up a new frame, explicitly dedicated to the code that gets executed due to our function call <code>average(4, z, z - 2)</code>. We'll call it "frame 1" because it's the first frame other than the global frame. We also write "average", to make it clear that's the name of the function we're calling.</p>
<p>Last, we write "p = [global]" to indicate frame 1's parent is the global frame. Every frame has a parent frame, similar to how every function has a parent frame. The parent frame for frame 1 is the global frame because frame 1 is for a call to <code>average</code>, and <code>average</code>'s parent frame is global. <strong>The parent of a frame should always correspond to the parent of the function that's being called.</strong></p>
