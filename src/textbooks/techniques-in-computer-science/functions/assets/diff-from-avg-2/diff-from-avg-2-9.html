<p>Now that the flag for <code>average(1, 2, 3)</code> is done, we open a frame. (Remember, this is all in the procedure from the previous section, above.) It's the first frame other than global, so we'll call it frame 1. It's parent is the global frame because it corresponds to a call to <code>average</code>, and the parent of <code>average</code> is the global frame.</p>
