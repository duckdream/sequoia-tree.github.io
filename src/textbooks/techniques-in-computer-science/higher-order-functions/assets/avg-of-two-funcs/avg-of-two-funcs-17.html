<p>Now we fill in the flag banner. We look for <code>average</code> in frame 2 first, since that's the first frame above our flag. It's not there so we have to look in frame 2's parent, which is frame 1. Unfortunately <code>average</code> isn't there either, so we move on to the global frame. There we find it's bound to a pointer at a funcion. Let's copy that pointer into the flag banner, right below where we've written <code>average</code>.</p>
