<p>To fill in the flag banner we need to know the value of <code>f</code>. Since frame 2 is the first frame above the flag, we look for it there first. Since it isn't there we look in frame 2's parent, which is frame 1. There we see <code>f</code> is bound to a pointer at the function <code>square</code>. Copy that pointer down into our flag banner.</p>
