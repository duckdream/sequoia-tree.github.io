<p>Then we start frame 2, to perform the function call. Notice how it corresponds to the function <code>g</code>. That's because we're calling a function whose name is <code>g</code>. It doesn't matter that we were using the name <code>h</code> to refer to that function. (Think of it like this. <code>h</code> is just the name of a variable. That variable is bound to a function. The name of the function is <code>g</code>. And the frame corresponds to the function, not the variable we used to refer to that function, so we write <code>g</code> next to frame 2.) Also frame 2's parent is frame 1, since that's the parent of <code>g</code>.</p>
