<p>According to the defintion of <code>g</code> in the code above, we need to return <code>x</code>. But there's no <code>x</code> in frame 2. We search for it in frame 2's parent, which is frame 1. There we find that <code>x</code> is 4, so we can return 4. Notice that if we looked for <code>x</code> in the global frame, where this function was called from, we would've found 8. That would've been wrong!</p>
