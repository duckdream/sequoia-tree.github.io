<p>Then we have to evaluate everything written on the flag banner, which in this case is just <code>f</code>. We search for it in the global frame because that's the frame above the flag we're working on. In the global frame we find that <code>f</code> is bound to a pointer, so we copy that pointer down onto the flag banner like so.</p>
