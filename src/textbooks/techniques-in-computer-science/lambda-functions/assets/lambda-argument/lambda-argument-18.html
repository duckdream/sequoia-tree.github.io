<p>Then we proceed with frame 1, which was for a call on the function <code>f</code>. We arrive at the line <code>return lambda<sub>1</sub> y: x + y</code>. This means we're making a new pointer to a new function named λ<sub>1</sub>, and then returning that pointer. Notice how λ<sub>1</sub>'s parent is frame 1, since that's the frame where we created it.</p>
