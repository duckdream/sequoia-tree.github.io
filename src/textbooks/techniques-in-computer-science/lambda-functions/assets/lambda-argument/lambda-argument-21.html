<p>The flag banner for <code>f(x - 9, lambda<sub>2</sub>: x)</code> is complete, and it tells us we're calling λ<sub>1</sub> on the argument 10. It's time to start the corresponding frame, which is frame 4. Notice how its parent frame is 1, since that's the parent of λ<sub>1</sub>, the function we're calling.</p>
