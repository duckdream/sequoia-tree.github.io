<p>According to the code above, we can see Î»~1~ is just supposed to return <code>x + y</code>. <code>x</code> isn't in frame 4 so we have to look for it in frame 4's parent frame. That's frame 1, which says <code>x</code> is 1. On the other hand <code>y</code> is already defined in frame 4, where it's bound to 10. So in the end we're just adding 1 + 10 to get 11.</p>
