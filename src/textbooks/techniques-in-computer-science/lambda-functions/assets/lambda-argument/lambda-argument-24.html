<p>Now that the function call it complete, we can go back to the global frame where we left off on the line <code>y = f(x - 9, lambda<sub>2</sub>: x)(x)</code>. Since we just learned that <code>f(x - 9, lambda<sub>2</sub>: x)(x)</code> is 11, it looks <code>y</code> is getting bound to 11. This completes the pyagram.</p>
