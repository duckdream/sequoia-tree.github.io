<p>The next step is to fill in the first flag banner with the value of <code>f(x - 9, lambda<sub>2</sub>: x)</code>. Since this is itself a function call, we'll require another flag in the pyagram. This second flag goes inside the first one. It consists of a function <code>f</code>, as well as two arguments <code>x - 9</code> and <code>lambda<sub>2</sub>: x</code>.</p>
