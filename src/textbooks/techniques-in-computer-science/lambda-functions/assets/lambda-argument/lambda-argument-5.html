<p>Then we will need to evaluate the arguments. To get <code>x - 9</code> we need to know what <code>x</code> is. Just look it up in the first frame above the flag we're working on. That's the global frame, where <code>x</code> is 10 so <code>x - 9</code> is 1.</p>
<p>We also need to know the value of <code>lambda<sub>2</sub>: x</code>. This expression directly evaluates to a new pointer at a new function, which we'll call "Î»<sub>2</sub>" to indicate it corresponds to <code>lambda<sub>2</sub></code> in our annotated code above. <strong>Notice how its parent is the global frame, since we haven't yet transitioned to frame 1.</strong></p>
