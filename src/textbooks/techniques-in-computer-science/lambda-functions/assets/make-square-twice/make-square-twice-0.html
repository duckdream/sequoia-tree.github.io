<p>As before, we open up frame 1 for the call to <code>make_square</code>, where we evaluate the <code>lambda</code> expression to get a new pointer at a new squaring function. The function's parent is frame 1, since that's the frame where we create it. Then we return the pointer from the call to <code>make_square</code>, and bind it to the variable <code>square_1</code> in the global frame.</p>
