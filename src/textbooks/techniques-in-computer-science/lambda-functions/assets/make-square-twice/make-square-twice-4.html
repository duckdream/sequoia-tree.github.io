<p>Once the flag is done, we can start a new frame. This one will be called frame 2, since it's the second frame other than the global frame. Like frame 1, it's for <code>make_square</code>. Frame 2's parent is the global frame, since it corresponds to a call to <code>make_square</code>, and the parent of <code>make_square</code> is the global frame.</p>
