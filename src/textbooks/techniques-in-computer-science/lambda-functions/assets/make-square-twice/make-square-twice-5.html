<p>When we evaluate the <code>lambda</code> expression for the second time, it produces a new pointer at a new squaring function, rather than referring to the same one from before. (Remember, you get a new function every time you read the word <code>lambda</code>.) Its parent is frame 2, since that's the frame we're in when we evaluate it. This pointer gets returned from the call to <code>make_square</code>.</p>
