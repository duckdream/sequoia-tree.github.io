<p>Finally that pointer is bound to <code>square_2</code> in the global frame. Notice how <code>square_1</code> and <code>square_2</code> end up pointing to different functions. That's because <code>square_1</code> got bound to the pointer returned from the function call <code>make_square()</code>, and <code>square_2</code> got bound to the pointer returned from a <em>different</em> function call <code>make_square()</code>. Each function call produced a new pointer and a new <code>lambda</code> function.</p>
