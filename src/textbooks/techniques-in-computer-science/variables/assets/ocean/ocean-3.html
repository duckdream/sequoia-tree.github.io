<p>The next line is <code>whale * dolphin</code>, which equals 5000. You might notice this value doesn't get assigned to a variable. Python still calculates the number 5000 and displays it on the screen, but since we don't tell it to keep track of 5000 with a variable, Python will forget about it immediately. Our pyagram looks the same as before.</p>
