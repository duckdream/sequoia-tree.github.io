<p>Now let's move on to the fourth line. It's a bit too complicated to do mentally, so let's use the 3-step procedure for variable assignment that we learned earlier.</p>
<ol>
<li>Cover the left side. For now, we just care about the <code>= int(whale / dolphin)</code> part.</li>
<li>Evaluate the right side. <code>int(whale / dolphin)</code> evaluates to the integer 2, since <code>whale / dolphin</code> evaluates to the float 2.0.</li>
<li>Now we look at the left side. We see the name <code>fish</code>, so we assign <code>fish</code> to 2.</li>
</ol>
