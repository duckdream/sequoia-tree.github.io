<p>We just have one more line to go: <code>fish *= 'splash '</code>. It's shorthand for saying <code>fish = fish * 'splash '</code>. Since <code>fish</code> is currently 2, it should get reassigned to the string <code>'splash splash '</code>. If that's confusing, we could also try applying the 3-step procedure from before.</p>
<ol>
<li>Cover the left side. For now, we just care about the <code>= fish * 'splash '</code> part.</li>
<li>Evaluate the right side. <code>fish * 'splash '</code> evaluates to <code>'splash splash '</code>, since <code>fish</code> is 2.</li>
<li>Now we look at the left side. We see the name <code>fish</code>, so we assign <code>fish</code> to <code>'splash splash '</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now we have finished the pyagram.</p>
