<p>Hi, I’m Sequoia, an enthusiastic {{ age }}-year-old with interests in dinosaurs, aliens, and robots. I’m also a Regents Scholar at UC Berkeley, where I learn and teach computer science. When I’m not studying, teaching, or developing courseware, I do machine learning research at the UC Berkeley AUTOLab. I put my spare time towards developing interdisciplinary data science modules with the Berkeley Institute of Data Science, and playing text adventures online.<p>
